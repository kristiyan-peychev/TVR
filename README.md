#A simple server/client TCP voice chat 
Made as a project for HackBulgaria's System-C course. 
I will spawn READMEs for both the client and the server, explaining how to compile and/or use them. 
`TVR = TCP/IP Voice Relay`

Known issues:
* There is a one-to-three second delay on the voice, even for clients running on the same machine as the server;
* You can hear yourself while talking in the same room, the microphone picks up whatever your speakers are outputting;
* There should be a ban command, but there is not;
* There should be private rooms, perhaps with a password, but there is not;
* There should be commands, but there are none;
* Why the hell are these here and not in a TODO file?
